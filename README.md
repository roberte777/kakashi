## AI

- AI is used to ask questions to, even specifically about the codebase
- AI is used to write the README

AI is **NOT** used to generate any code!

## Features

- App launching
- emojis
- clipboard history
- commands
- plugins
- file searching
- calculator
- window management

## Visuals

- Have to have a way to theme it
- Looks clean, not over doing it. Transparency

## First Milestone

- First milestone is a regular app launcher that looks and feels the way we want
- Needs to be wayland native(?) using layer shell
- Trait per subsystem (like zeroclaw)

## Second Milestone

File finding. If we want to do it right, we may have to dive deep. MacOS does
indexing of their file system, which is why spotlight can do it so quickly
